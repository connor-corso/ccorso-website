Then the bigBounce method will be called, then the randomBounce method, and then the bigBounce method again before looping\nbigBounce takes no arguments and will first look at the value in the timer compare register to see where the servo is currently positioned, and then will start at the opposite end and slowly move across to the other side\nrandomBounce takes no arguments and will generate a random number between 0 and 14, and based on that number will call randomWobble with a different base position argument\nrandomWobble will take an base, an int and will then move in a quick back and forth motion around that base position"

I am going to start with the projects page as that is the page that I have the most content for and that I think will allow me to show what I have been working on.

Normally these videos are only accessible when you use Google Photos, however if Google has a way of extracting these images then there must be some way for other applications to access these videos. With this project I plan on first building a basic web app that takes a motion photo upload and splits it into both the regular image and the video."
